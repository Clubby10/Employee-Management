# Employee-Management

This project is an Employee Management system that allows users to add, edit, and delete employee information. The system also provides functionality to view a list of all employees, search for employees by name or ID, and generate reports.

The program is built using Python programming language and uses the object-oriented approach to create Employee objects and manage them using a EmployeeManagement class. The program interacts with the user through the command-line interface (CLI), which displays a menu of options to perform various actions on the employee data.

The program also provides the functionality to save all employee data to a text file, which can be loaded later to resume the employee management process. This feature ensures the persistence of employee data and enables users to continue from where they left off when they reopen the program.

Overall, this project is a useful tool for businesses or organizations that need to manage employee information in a centralized system.
